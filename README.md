# vimrc.vim

This plugin replaces the lion's share of my `.vimrc`. It is a superset of [`vim-sensible`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible).

## Installation

Backup somewhere your current `~/.vim` directory, and:

```
git clone https://github.com/sheerun/vimrc.git ~/.vim
```

Your `.vimrc` should have following format:

```vim
runtime vimrc.vim

" Your code here...
```

## Features

* [other additions](https://github.com/sheerun/vimrc.vim/blob/master/plugin/vimrc.vim#L127)
